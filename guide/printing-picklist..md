# How to print the Picklist from the Staff-Portal

## Go to the picklist

[The Picklist can be found here,](http://10.0.8.54/staff-portal/circulation/picklist)

The page looks like this:

## Select your branch

Find the area at the top labeled **'branch'**

Click the `[un-select all]` button (this de-selects all branches)

Click your desired branch (e.g. Gordon). The 'switch' icon next to your branch will turn blue.

## Select your desired sorting options

Find the section at the top labeled **'sorting'**

The default sorting options are:  
  - `pickdept`: This is the department _within_ a branch. Please ignore unless you are a 'power user'  :)
  - `loc`: This is the location code for the item (e.g. `ams` for Gordon Main Stacks)
  - `callnum`: This is the item's call number

If you are comfortable doing so, you may click `[clear all]` to clear the sorting order.
You may then click one of the table header columns (e.g. `department`) to sort by that column.

## Printing

You may use your computer's 'Print' function (pressing `Ctrl-P`, or using the file menu `File > Print`.

The top of the webpage (the sorting options, the branch buttons, etc) will **not** print to the page. This is by design.

## Exporting to a spreadsheet

You may also export the page to a spreadsheet. Click the `[Download Visible]` button on the top right. You will be presented with a dialog box to save the file. Choose your desired location on your computer to download the file. Open with your spreadsheet program of choice. You may print from that file if you prefer.
